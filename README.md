# Zigfuck

Zigfuck is a compiler for the famous esolang "brainfuck", written in Zig. 

## Backends

Currently, there is only a native backend which outputs executables targetting Linux x64.

## Targets

The only supported target is Linux x64. 

## Roadmap

Zigfuck is intended to implement more sophisticated optimisations, and more backends, for broader target support (and further optimisation).
